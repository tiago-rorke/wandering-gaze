# Assembly

## Unpacking
1. Remove all the elements from inside the machine, marking them off the checklist.
2. Remove the machine from inside the black frame cover. Lift it out by holding onto the vertical part (the short side) of the aluminium frame.  **Please do not lift from the horizontal part of the frame, or any other part of the machine.** After removing it, lay the machine face down on the large foam sheet.
3. To remove the black frame cover, first remove some of the surrounding foam.

## Frame  
1. Lift the machine from it's wooden frame, and flip it over so that it is resting on its brackets on the floor.  Slide off the glass cover, and distribute the metal shwarf around the bottom edge of the photo.
2. Clean the glass if necessary and slide it back into the frame.
3. Fix the slotted standards to the wall, taking note of the ends labelled 'top'. The ideal distance to the floor from the bottom edge is 1200mm, the distance between the standards should be 1160mm.
4. Still with the black cover removed, lift the machine again from it's wooden frame, and hang it on the standards. The lower bracket should enter just below the red tape marks.
5. Ensure that the power and usb cables are falling from the center of the frame, and put on the black frame cover.
  
## Tripod  
1. Assemble the three legs to the tripod base, ensuring the power and usb extension cables exit at the front corner of the base, and that the two short usb cables exit at the top of the left leg. Use 3 of the medium length socket-head cap screws.  
2. With the cover of the pc box removed, attach it to the three legs, taking note of the front label and passing the cables through the holes in the corners. Use 3 of the long cap screws.  
3. Connect all the cables in the box following the labels, and also the unique fan connector which is not labelled. Fasten the lid of the box using the 3 short low profile cap screws.  
  
## Viewfinder  
1. Sit the viewfinder on the top of the tripod ensuring it is facing forwards. Fasten using the 3 short cap screws.
2. Connect the two usb cables to the corresponding sockets on the viewfinder.  
3. If necessary, clean the glass pane, then insert it into the slot of the viewfinder.  

# Powering On/Off
- The power button of the PC can be accessed via a hole on the bottom of the box.  Press the button once to power on or to power off.  It is not necessary to hold down the button.  While powering on or off, the light visible from the front of the box will be green.  When the system has finished booting it will be blue.  When powering off, please wait for the green light to turn off before unplugging or switching off the power.
- While the eyetracking program is starting up, the red led in the viewfinder will be blinking. Once it is ready to use the led will be off.

# Calibration  
Before the installation can be used the position of the viewfinder must be carefully adjusted:  
1. Make sure the system is powered on and ready to use and put the overlay cover on the viewfinder, with the right eye looking through the grid.
2. Adjust the 3 screws holding the viewfinder, moving the tripod if necessary, until both:  
	- the edges of the inside of the frame are aligned with the boundaries of the grid on the overlay.  
	- and the red led of the viewfinder is aligned with the center of the cross of the grid.  
3. Once adjusted, remove the overlay cover.

# Usage
- When someone looks through the viewfinder, they will see a red light appear.  They must look at the light until it disappears, at which point they can look at the photograph.
- Once they step away from the viewfinder, the machine will begin to retrace the path the viewer's eye has taken, spending more time in the areas where the viewer's gaze has lingered.

# Troubleshooting
- If the red light doesn't come on, or is on and doesn't turn off, please shut down the system, unplug the usb cables from the viewfinder, wait a few seconds, plug them back in and turn it back on again.
- If the red light is blinking, or doesn't stop blinking after powering on the PC, please unplug the usb cable from the viewfinder (the one closest to front/eyepiece side of the viewfinder), wait a few seconds, and plug it back in.  If it is still blinking after 15s or so, do the same with the usb connection to the machine.  If it is still blinking, try powering the PC off and on again.
